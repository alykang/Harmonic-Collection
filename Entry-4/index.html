            <p> The Bird of Paradise enjoys direct and indirect bright sunlight. When watering, make sure the plant is thoroughly
                watered so that there is water leaking out of the bottom of the pot. Water again when the soil feels slightly dry but 
                not completely dried up. The plant's soil should not be allowed to dry up in between waterings. It thrives in temperatures 
                ranging from 65°F-85°F.

                This plant is named after the botanist Bartolomeo Maranta. There are many different plants that fall into the Maranta genus. The prayer plant
                gets its name from the way its leaves lay flat during the day and fold up during the night. They are low-growing plants that are quite distinguishable by their 
                brightly colored varigation.
