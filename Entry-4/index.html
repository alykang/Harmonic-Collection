        <p> The wandering dude, also known as the wandering jew, silver inch, or tradescantia zebrina, is a native
            plant from Mexico. They are grown as houseplants in North America. Because they are considered invasive
            in warm outdoor regions, keep them in indoor spaces as houseplants.

<h2 class="header-two">How to care for the Wandering Dude Plant</h2>
        <div class="sunlight">
            The Tradescantia Zebrina thrives in bright indirect sunlight. In fact, the more sunlight it gets, the more purple the plant gets.
            However, try to avoid bright direct light as it can burn the delicate leaves of the plant. 
        </div>
<br> 
        <div class="sunlight-2">
            My Tradescantia is placed right in front of an east-facing window where it recieves plenty of indirect sunlight during the day.
            Due to the abundance of bright light it recieves, I notice that it grows extremely quickly and the purple is much more vibrant
            on the side that faces the window. If you want an even-looking plant, I suggest rotating the plant every one to two weeks to ensure
            each side gets enough sunlight. 
        </div>
<br>
        <div class="watering">
            Never let the soil of a Tradescantia dry out completely. You want to make sure the soil is consistently moist. This most likely means 
                watering every week during hotter seasons and once every two to three weeks in the colder climates. But this measurement will
                definitely vary so your best bet is to check soil moisture levels every week to see if it needs to be watered.
        </div>
<br>
        <div class="watering-2">
            During summer I tend to give my plant a thorough watering every week during since it gets quite a bit of sunlight for long hours of
            the day. It also tends to get hot indoors so the soil becomes dry faster than it does in the winter. During the winter, my plant does
            not recieve as high intensity sunlight and it resides in a much cooler indoor environment, thus, I tend to water it every two to three 
            weeks. No matter the season, I use my soil moister meter to check up on my plant every week just in case I need to water it or skip watering
            it for the week.
