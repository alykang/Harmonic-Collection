                    <p>In order to ensure that your plant does not get root rot by over watering it, choose a pot that has drainage holes or a terracotta pot.
                    A pot with a hole will allow excess water to drain out the bottom and a terracotta pot will allow the soil to dry out quicker.
                    Snake plants prefer bright indirect light to direct light. Changing the light intensity suddenly can cause your plant to go into
                    shock so gradually introduce them to the light change before moving its location. In addition, make sure to keep the plant in warmer
                    temperatures and away from drafty windows in the winter or colder climates. The snake plant is a succulent so the key to keeping it alive is to not overwater it.

                    The snake plant is a popular beginner plant since they are low-maintenance. 
                    It is a succulent plant that is native to southern Africa. They thrive well in condiitons similar to southern 
                    Africa such as the southern regions of the United States. They are also often grown outside in hotter climates, 
                    but be aware that they have the potential to become invasive, similar to bamboo.
