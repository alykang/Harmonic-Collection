            <div class="origins">
                <p> Also known as the Sansevieria, the snake plant is a popular beginner plant since they are low-maintenance. 
                It is a succulent plant that is native to southern Africa. They thrive well in condiitons similar to southern 
                Africa such as the southern regions of the United States. They are also often grown outside in hotter climates, 
                but be aware that they have the potential to become invasive, similar to bamboo. </p>

<h2 class="header-two">How to care for the Snake Plant</h2>
        <div class="watering">
            <p>In order to ensure that your plant does not get root rot by over watering it, choose a pot that has drainage holes or a terracotta pot.
             A pot with a hole will allow excess water to drain out the bottom and a terracotta pot will allow the soil to dry out quicker.</p>
<br> 
            <p>Snake plants prefer bright indirect light to direct light. Changing the light intensity suddenly can cause your plant to go into
            shock so gradually introduce them to the light change before moving its location. In addition, make sure to keep the plant in warmer
            temperatures and away from drafty windows in the winter or colder climates.</p>
<br>
            <p>The snake plant is a succulent so the key to keeping it alive is to not overwater it. Here are some tips to make sure you don't overwater
            your plant:</p>
        </div>

<ul class="tips">
    <br>
    <li>Let the soil dry out between waterings (invest in a soil moisture meter to get an acurate reading on the moisture level of the soil).</li>
    <li>If possible, water from the bottom of the pot. This encourages the roots of the plant to grow downward and result in a strong, tall, and stable plant.
        Simply place a tray under the pot (with drainage holes) and pour water in the tray. The soil will soak up the water from the tray and reach
        the roots of the plant.</li>
    <li>Water your plant less often during the colder seasons. This may mean that you only water your plant once a month!</li>
</ul>
