                Propagation is the process of reproducing a single parent plant into multiple children plants.
                Propagation differs from reproduction because it utilizes a semi-mature plant and thus, requires less time to reproduce.

                    The best and easiest way to propagate your plant is to use the cutting method.

                    Tools and equipment:

                        <li>A plant</li>
                        <li>A small vase or jar</li>
                        <li>Water</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Find the node that has a 4-8 inch stem length and has about 2-3 leaves attached. </li>
                    <li>Make a diagonal cut just below the node.</li>
                    <li>Place the cutting in a tall glass filled with water so that the roots are just below the surface of the water. </li>
                    <li>In about a week, roots should begin to form by the node of the cutting. Once a strong root system has developed, or at least
                        one root that is about 4 inches long, pot the cutting as usual using lightweight potting soil.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot where it will recieve indirect bright light. Start by watering it heavily to help it transition to the soil. Keep it 
                        moist but not soaking.
