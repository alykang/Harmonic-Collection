            My pothos was looking droopy this morning. The leaves also felt thin and the soil felt dry so I gave it a thorough watering. 
            I went to check on the plant after a couple hours and the leaves had perked up and felt thicker. It looked more alive and 
            the color was less dull. Since it hasn't been as sunny lately, I probably won't have to water it again for at least two weeks.

             My Maranta plant used to bloom flowers. It hasn't in a while though because it's not recieving as much sun as it 
             does during the summer. Plus, the weather is quite cold so my plant looks depressed all the time.

             There's been an obscene amount of gnats in my home lately so I had to spray my plants with neem oil. It helps 
             keep pests away but it truely smells horrendous and because the weather is so cold outside, I couldn't let them
             air out outside. I left them in the shower instead so it could stink up the bathroom and not my room.

             My pothos has grown some new leaves in the past few days. I've had to add some new plant clips on the ceilings to 
             attach new growth. New leaves that have been growing recently have been smaller than the leaves at the root. I suspect 
             it's because the weather and because the plant is so tall that there are not as many nutrients reaching the tips of each 
             extending stem.
