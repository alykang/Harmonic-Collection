        <h2>Basic Care</h2>
            <p> Prayer plants enjoy a warm and moist environment that provides gentle airflow and indirect sunlight. Direct sun can damage the leaves by burning them.
                In the winter, prayer plants will go dormant. During this time, continue providing your plant with indirect bright light to maintain life and growth.
            </p>
            <p>During the hot seasons, water Prayer plants often with room temperature water. It's important to never let your prayer plant dry out because they are 
            particularly prone to drought. However, do not let your plant sit in soaked soil for long periods of time as it could result in root rot and cause rotting leaves. 
            </p>
            <p> Temperatures between 60 to 90 degrees is ideal for the Prayer plant. They also enjoy humid climates. In order to mimic one, you could periodically mist your plant, place a tray filled with stones
                and a little bit of water under the plant pot, or keep a humidifier near your plant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fertilizing your prayer plant is also critical to their growth. Between the months of spring and fall your should fertilize your plant every two
                weeks that is water-soluable and has been diluted to hald strengh. Watering your plant with too much fertilizer or fertilizer that has not been diluted
                enough can cause the leaves to brown and your plant to die.
